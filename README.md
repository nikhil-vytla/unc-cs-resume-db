# unc-cs-resume-db (UNC CS Summer of Code 2020)

## Description

The UNC CS Department, through the UNC Summer of Code 2020 program has created a dynamic resume database website. Currently, resumes are available to recruiters via PDF and Handshake, however recruiters must manually search through these lists. This website allows recruiters to filter through students based on criteria such as graduation year and specific programming languages. Additionally, recruiters can organize students into lists to save qualified candidates and export these lists. This site is built with React and Firebase and will greatly help recruiting in a post-COVID-19 world.
