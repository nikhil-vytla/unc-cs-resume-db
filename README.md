# unc-cs-resume-db (UNC CS Summer of Code 2020)

## Description

The UNC CS Department through the Unc Summer of Code program has created a dynamic resume database. This resume data allows recruiters to filter through students based on criteria such as graduation year and specific programming languages. Additionally, recruiters can organize students into lists to save qualified candidates for later review. Currently, resumes are available via PDF and also via Handshake. This site is built with React and Firebase and will greatly help recruiting in a post-COVID-19 world.
