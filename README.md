# unc-cs-resume-db (UNC CS Summer of Code 2020)

### Description
The UNC CS Department wants to create a dynamic resume book for sponsors and recruiters. Currently, resumes are available via PDF and also via Handshake but they would like to use a curated approach so that recruiters can search. This will be a **web-based application** and will greatly help recruiting in a post-COVID-19 world. Relevant languages/technical experience are *up to the discretion of the team* because no work has been done on this product so far, but it will be a website.
